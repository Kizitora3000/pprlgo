/*
Please refer to https://github.com/tuneinsight/lattigo/tree/master/ckks#readme for detail information of parameter.

LogN: 	This parameter use for "N = 2^logN".
		Parameter N has an impact on both security and performance.
		(i.g. security increases with N and performance decreases with N)

LogQ:	This parameter is used to calculate Q from the product of a chain of small coprime moduli.
		Parameter Q has an impact on both security and performance.
		(i.g. for a fixed N, a larger Q implies both lower security and lower performance)

LogP:	This parameter is σ and the variance used for the error polynomials.
		Parameter σ is close relationship for security.
		(i.g. a larger σ implies higher security)

LogScale:	This parameter use for "scale = 2^LogScale".
			Parameter scale affects accuracy as scale is multiplied by plaintext for encryption.
			(i.g. a larger scale implies more accuracy)

Check the security level: GetMinimumLevelForRefresh in lattigo/dckks/dutils.go
(But this function maybe doesn't use?)
